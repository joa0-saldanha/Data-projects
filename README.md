## Data engineering projects

This portfolio will focus on my development in data engineering, containing all the projects and studies that will be worked on over time.<br>The portfolio will be updated according to my evolution in the projects.

The projects will be mostly developed using the following technologies:

• Programming language: Python;<br>
• Apache Spark / PySpark: data analysis and manipulation;<br>
• Pandas: data analysis;<br>
• Apache Airflow: data pipeline development and orchestration;<br>
• Docker: containerized development.<br>




# •1 - League of Legends Champions Analysis:

[League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/) is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. A game in which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an isometric perspective.

We will analyze some statistics of the champions of the marksman category using PySpark, which is an Apache Spark framework API developed for the Python programming language, and a notebook in Google Colab, wich is free cloud service created by google that allows anyone to write and run arbitrary Python code via the browser and is especially suited for machine learning, data analysis and education.

All data used were extracted from the [Data Dragon](https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol) web API, a public API by Riot Games.    

The project can be seen here: [LOL Marksman Analysis](https://github.com/joaoaos/Data-projects/blob/main/MarksmanAnalysis_LOL.ipynb)
